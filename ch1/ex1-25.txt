This is much less efficient and can even cause integer overflows
in the case of larger numbers. The footnote on page 52 explains:
"The reduction steps in the cases where the exponent `e` is greater
than 1 are based on the fact that, for any integers `x`, `y`, and `m`,
we can find the remainder of `x` times `y` modulo `m` by computing
separately the remainders of `x` modulo `m` and `y` modulo `m`,
multiplying these and then taking the remainder of the result modulo
`m`. For instance, in the case where `e` is even, we compute the
remainder of `b^(e/2)` modulo `m`, square this, and take the remainder
modulo `m`. This technique is useful because it means we can perform
our computation without ever having to deal with numbers much larger
than `m`."
